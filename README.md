This is a work in progress project I started as a way to introduce myself to Prisma and using it with a Express.js backend. Currently the essential features are implemented, CRUD of the tests with the db, collaborating with other users, user auth... 

Feel free to contribute to the project as this is just a beginning, and has plenty of room for improvements, and of course, if you like the project, leave a star :)
